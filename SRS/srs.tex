\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
This Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) are the main reference document concerning the Shared Apartments Web Application Rentr. Principle reading parties of the document are the customer (Haydar Osman), and Team 8: Michael Grünig, Sara Peeters and Daniel Ziltener, the developers.

Written in a language understandable for all parties, it aims at giving a complete overview of the project, as currently agreed on. To this end, terms acronyms and abbreviations required to properly interpret the SRS are declared under the Definitions subsection of this section. Furthermore this introductory section contains a quick overview of the project stakeholders, as well as the system under development. A complete list of references to further documents used in the project is also provided.

In the second section functional and non-functional requirements are enlisted. As for the functional requirements we provide a detailed definition list of the main components. How the components will interact is not described in this section. Therefore we refer to the use cases in section 3. We aim to keep this list complete, unambiguous and the requirements verifiable. Requirements will be ordered to priority.

The third section provides an in-depth overview of the system under development from a user point of view. Use cases are schematically represented and described in detail. Also user characteristics are analyzed and described in this section.


The developers commit to updating the document after each customer-meeting, assuring that it represents the project specifications in the best possible way at any time. The customer commits to report mistakes and unclarities in the document to the developers, so that these can be corrected.

\subsection{Stakeholders}
\begin{description}
\item[The customer]is the ordering party in this contract.  He will own and operate the web application after development. 
\item[A Client] of the web application is a internet user who registers to use the services provided by the web application developed.
\end{description}
\subsection{Definitions}
\textit{There are no definitions or abbreviations in this section yet. If any of the terms used in the document are unclear, please notify us, so it can be added to this section.}
\subsection{System goals}
To have the best features of the three pages listed: \\
wgzimmer.ch, \\
students.ch/wohnen \\
and tutti.ch/bern/immobilien/wg-zimmer.

\subsection{System overview}
The system consists of a client-side website and a server-side application containing all the logic, using Java EE as the platform, the Spring Framework for structure, Spring Data together with MySQL for data storage, JSF for webpage structure and Persona as authentication framework.

Users have to log in to the website using Persona (aka BrowserID) and create a profile. Users can then create ads or search for ads. Searches can be stored as alerts, and the user gets notified whenever a new ad is placed matching the criteria. Ad placers can place dates for visits where other users can subscribe. They can also manage visits and enquiries on the webpage. E-Mail-notifications are available.
The administrator can modify and delete users and ads.

\subsubsection{current state and location}
After compiling and starting (mvn jetty:run) the web-app can be found at \href{https://localhost:8443/}{https://localhost:8443/}.\\
Currently implemented usecases are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item As a user I want to place an ad for advertising a room in a shared apartment
\item As a user I want to search for relevant ads in a specific area
\item As a user I want to get exhaustive information about a room (e.g. pictures, location, roommate profiles, ..)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{References}
\textit{There are no external references yet. They will be added to this section as needed.}
\section{Specific requirements and definitions}
\subsection{System element definitions}
\subsubsection{Profile}
Each normal user has a profile. 
A profile consists of 2 parts: An obligatory part and an optional part.
Each element contained in a user profile is either visible (V) to other users, or not ().

Obligatory profile:
\begin{itemize}
\item (V) Name

\end{itemize}
Optional profile:

\item (V) profile picture
\item (V) Description
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Ad}
Ads are an important component of the web application. 
Some, but not all elements of an ad are searchable (S),
which means that a search can in some way select for this criterium.
\begin{itemize}
\item () Title
\item (S) Address

	Note: address consists of Street, number, ZIP-code and city. ZIP-code and city are searchable.
\item (S) Category (shared apartment or apartment)

\item () Free until

	Note: can be unlimited, or a date
%	is searchable by indicating no limit or a date and one of the options (strict, or earlier, or later).
%\item (S) Languages spoken
\item () Keywords

	Note: Keywords help to personalize a search, without getting lost in the different terms 
	that can be used for the same thing in a description.
	They are selected from a list.
	Some examples: Vegetarian/Vegan, Non-vegetarian, Quiet neighbourhood, Party-zone, 
	Shared garden/Balcony, bike parking, staying weekends, eating/cooking together...
\item () Pictures
\item () Description
\item () Roommates

%	Note: Searchable on sex (all male, all female, no preference).
%	Searchable on age via a from-to-field.
%	Number of roommates is searchable via a from-to-field.
\item () response method: enquiry and/or timeschedule 
\item () Deactivated
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Non-functional requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Secure login and data
    User should confirm registration through email link.
    Captcha is used in registration form.
    passwords must have a minimum length 
    maximum number of  login attempts from the same IP. 
\item Logging
    All site traffic is logged in different log files, documenting each user action.
\item Responsive design
    The website adapts to mobile users (smartphones and tablets).
    The website will be tested in the latest Firefox and Chrome version.
    (On which mobile devices will we test our website)

\subsection{Actor Characteristics}
All users are logged in and have a minimal user profile (name, email address,...)

The clients of our website are people looking for a (shared) apartment in Switzerland.
The main user group will be between aged 18 - 29 years old. 
We expect most but not all apartments to be in and around univeristy cities.
These users can place ads for (shared) apartments or search the ads. 
We expect these group of users to be the largest group of actors.

Another actor group is the administrator group. This is a small group of 1 to 5 people, who can view all information about users and ads. Members of this group are permitted by our customer.
